# Sales Performance and Forecast Analysis Using Excel
##Project Objective
To evaluate and improve sales performance by analyzing transactional sales data against regional sales forecasts, with the goal of identifying performance gaps, uncovering sales trends, and supporting data-driven business decisions through Excel-based reporting and visualization.

##Data used
-<a href="https://github.com/chandruseenivasan/Sales_Performance_Analysis-Forecast-Comparison/blob/main/Sales%20Performance.xlsx">Sales_Dataset</a>

##Key Responsibilities
* Cleaned, organized, and validated raw order data for accurate analysis across multiple dimensions (region, product category, customer segment, and time).
* Integrated actual sales data with regional sales forecasts to evaluate performance vs. plan.
*  Developed Excel-based pivot tables and summary dashboards to visualize sales trends and variances.
* Applied formulas (e.g., VLOOKUP, SUMIFS) to automate data aggregation and comparison.
* Analyzed regional sales performance to identify underperforming areas and growth opportunities.
* Generated reports highlighting key insights and presented findings to support strategic planning.
* Ensured data accuracy and consistency to maintain reliability of analysis.

##Project Process
1.Data Collection
* Gathered transactional order data and regional sales forecasts from Excel sheets.
2.Data Cleaning & Preparation
* Standardized date formats, corrected data inconsistencies, and ensured uniform region and category labels for accurate analysis.  
3.Data Integration
* Merged order data with forecasted sales plans to enable comparison between actual and planned figures.
4.Data Analysis
* Created pivot tables to analyze sales by region, product category, customer segment, and time (monthly/yearly).
* Applied Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, etc.) to calculate total sales, variances, and performance metrics.
5.Visualization & Reporting
* Built summary dashboards and charts to present insights in a clear, visual format.
* Highlighted key trends, such as overperforming or underperforming regions and categories.
6.Insight Generation
* Interpreted results to identify sales gaps, growth opportunities, and areas needing attention.
* Provided actionable insights to support strategic planning and performance improvement.

##Project Insights
1.Sales vs. Plan Variance
* Certain regions, such as the East, significantly underperformed compared to sales targets, while others, like the West, exceeded expectations.
2.Regional Performance Trends
* The West region consistently delivered the highest sales, indicating strong market potential or effective regional strategies.
* Central and South regions performed close to targets, suggesting stable but improvable execution.
3.Category-Level Observations
* Office Supplies had the most transactions but showed mixed performance across sub-categories (e.g., Binders, Paper, Art).
* Some niche sub-categories contributed disproportionately to revenue, highlighting potential areas for focus or expansion.
4.Segment Analysis
* The Consumer and Home Office segments represented the majority of sales, but their contribution varied by region, indicating potential for more targeted marketing.
5.Monthly & Yearly Sales Patterns
* Sales data showed monthly trends that could inform seasonal planning and inventory management.
* Year-over-year analysis indicated fluctuations in total sales, valuable for forecasting and goal-setting.
6.Forecasting Gaps
* Discrepancies between actual and planned sales revealed forecasting inaccuracies, suggesting the need for improved demand planning or market analysis methods.
